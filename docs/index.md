# Welcome to TechPvZ

TechPvZ is a wiki that aims to collect theories of Plants vs. Zombies. Chinese players have written numerous theories on PvZ, but few of them are accessible in English. Dedicated to providing useful knowledge to the PvZ players community, the main task of TechPvZ is to translate them into English. 

The current contributor to this wiki is [Mirai](https://github.com/H-J-Granger).
